### Release History

* v2.0.0 - `SVG` `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
	* All SVGs now come with a unique title ID. That may not sound like much but SVGs are very particular about their individualism.
		[#204](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/204)
* v1.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* The linklist is now a normal list that can be mixed link and non-link.
		[#181](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/181)
	* The linklist is now powered by an SVG rather than a CSS shape. This looks better on older browsers and low density displays.
	* We introduced a new class for a larger list and aligned the spacing of the default.
		[#183](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/183)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* BIG BOM brand change. All new colours, all new look, all new GUI. Brace yourselfs.
		[#157](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/157)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
