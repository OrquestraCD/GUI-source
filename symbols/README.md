> These symbols are commonly used in WBC user interfaces. They are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVG’s) with png fallback’s for older browsers.
> Using SVG’s ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the symbols using code and also complies with AA accessibility
> requirements.
