> Use these classes to add vertical spacing above elements based on the layout system. To maintain a visual rhythm and consistency in the UI we have a set of
> classes that use multiples of 6 when applying vertical spacing between elements. The lead visual designer will stipulate which margin to use.

### Release History

* v2.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Migrate to relative CSS units (a11y)
		[#456](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/456)
* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* We know all people (and projects for that matter) come in all forms and variation. We love the diversity and the new insights that this brings with it.
		Unfortunately the responsive margins were not diverse at all only giving you seven options for spacing. We expanded it’s mind in a flower-power filled
		group team-building exercise and now you have all kinds of margins. ALL KINDS!
		[#201](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/201)
	* (We moved to a neat mixin for margins, removed the block statement and bang important.)
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
