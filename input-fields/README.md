> Inputs are the most common form controls. Text-based input fields include support for all HTML5 types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month,
> time, week, number, email, url, search, tel, and colour. The date element triggers the date selector in compliant browsers.

### Release History

* v1.0.2 - `HTML` `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~
	* Our recent move to system fonts means we trust the system to take care of something as basic as the display of a font. Turns out you can't trust Microsoft
		with such a task as they increase the size of the font rather than just the face. We fixed that and wrote an ~~angry~~ constructive letter to Redmond.
		It's always important to vent your frustrations in a productive manner.
		[#174](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/174)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Somewhere at Microsoft a person decided that placeholder text should look like input text. Making it less placeholder text and more like... text.
		We were sure there was logic in there somewhere but we couldn't find it so we made it a tint in all browsers (including the elusive IE) to match the default
		styling of sensible browsers.
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
