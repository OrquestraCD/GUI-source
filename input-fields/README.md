===============

> Inputs are the most common form controls. Text-based input fields include support for all HTML5 types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month,
> time, week, number, email, url, search, tel, and colour. The date element triggers the date selector in compliant browsers.

### Release History

* v1.0.1 - Somewhere at Microsoft a person decided that placeholder text should look like text that someone had inputed. Making it less a placeholder text
	and more just text... We were sure there is logic in there somwhere but we couldn't find it so we made it gray in all browsers including the elusive IE.
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
