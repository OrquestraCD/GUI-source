GUI Fonts
=========

> The typography system caters for our multi-brand framework allowing us to implement brand specific web typography. Due to licensing issues we currently don’t
> use many brand specific web fonts however we’re hoping to resolve this soon. The system will then help us to implement brand specific fonts very easily.
> Never use a web font without prior confirmation that you have the correct licence agreement in place.

### Release History

* v1.0.1 - We removed the Roboto webfont as system font's have now gotten much better and our reliance on a body font is not necessary anymore.
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
