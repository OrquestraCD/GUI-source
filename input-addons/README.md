### Release History

* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* The text inside the selects had just enough space so you could read them comfortably. Unless the text included a descender or ascender. In that case it
		would have been just a bit uncomfortable as you had to guess some parts of the letter. No more guessing.
		[#139](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/139)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
