> Forms play an important role in our brand's products and services. All roads lead to a form so it’s important to get them right. These basic form
> elements have been carefully crafted and rigorously tested. Use them as the foundation for any form creation.

### Release History

* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
	* On Safari, not to name and shame any browser (#SafariIsTheNewIE), elements showed some space between each other even though all other browsers totally got
		what we wanted. The elements wanted to be together as they all grew up together so we had to explain that to Safari. After a little discussion about
		the merits of a tight family even Safari couldn’t deny the cuddling.
		[#205](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/205)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* The text inside the selects had just enough space so you could read them comfortably. Unless the text included a descender or ascender. In that case it
		would have been just a bit uncomfortable as you had to guess some parts of the letter. No more guessing.
		[#139](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/139)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
