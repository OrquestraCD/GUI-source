		[#151](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/151)
	* Printing the checkboxes although not very functional, will now at least look good and make clear what selection was selected.

* v2.0.0 - `SVG` `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
	* All SVGs now come with a unique title ID. That may not sound like much but SVGs are very particular about their individualism.
		[#204](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/204)
* v1.0.4 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* The checkboxes didn't flip anymore. Rather than flipping them off we taught them. Flipping awesome!
		[#197](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/197)
* v1.0.3 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Check out our checkboxes. We've added a no-image fallback to the them so when you're tired of seeing our beautiful designed artwork, you now have a
		fallback to the old boring native checkboxes, boooooo.

* v1.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* BIG BOM brand change. All new colours, all new look, all new GUI. Brace yourselfs.

* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* In some browsers the checkboxes appeared cut-off. That seemed a bit shy and insecure so we sent them to counselling. Now checkboxes
		proudly present their bottoms as well. [#128](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/128)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
