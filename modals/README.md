GUI Modals
==========

> Modals are streamlined, but flexible, dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart defaults. Modals should be easy to digest so that the
> user can quickly get back to what they were doing. Set the initial width of your modal depending on the amount of content you are showing.

### Release History

* v1.0.1 - ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ `JS` `HTML`
	* We got word that using our JavaScript in dynamic DOM application was a bit... clunky. Clunky wasn't good enough for us so we refactored all Javascript
		modules to unclunk all the things. Beware though, some JavaScript classes had to be injected to keep the modules clunk-free.
		[#140](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/140)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
