> This library of icons is intended for use across all of our brands and user interfaces. They are designed to aid navigation and legibility. The use of icons
> purely as page embellishment is not recommended and in some cases will be off brand. These icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVG’s) with
> png fallback’s for older browsers. Using SVG’s ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the icons using code and also
> complies with AA accessibility requirements.

### Release History

* v2.0.2 - `SVG` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Remove secondary `.symbol-*` prefix from all Icons. Icons use the `.icon-*` prefix and Symbols use the `.symbol-*` prefix exclusively.
* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
* v1.0.4 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fixed a bug in Firefox where the fallback loading gif and the loading animation would show both at the same time. That was a bit of an "overload" on
		loading so we fixed that.
		[#196](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/196)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
