### Release History

* v1.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` `JS` `HTML`
	* xxx
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* All our buttons have a specific height to abide to. When you added an icon in a button however, the buttons seized the opportunity to go rouge and
		added two pixels. We sat down with them and had a heart-to-heart. Now they know better. [#131](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/131)
	* The icons, set inside a soft button (also being naughty) didn't display in the font color which made it hard for us humans to see them. That too, was
		fixed. [#127](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/127) [#126](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/126)
	* On some handheld devices when taping and holding the button group, the active state looked cut-off and weird. Admittedly when you hold your finger on
		the screen you kind of hid the problem with your finger and it was hard for us to even find this bug but this is just another example of the extent of
		detailed work we put into this baby. [#129](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/129)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
