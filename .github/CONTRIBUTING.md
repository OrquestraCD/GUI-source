# How to contribute

We'd like to thank you for considering to contribute and donating your time to our project :heart_eyes::heart:  
You rock! :rocket::fist:

All contributions are welcome and we will consider your request/PR or issue in any case. We will likely even dream about it because that's how hard we think
about the GUI.

The fact that you are here and reading this means you care. We do too, so let's agree on some basic rules so we are all on the same page.

* To foster a welcoming environment we pledge to be respectful to everyone and we will enforce this respect everywhere we can.
* We love your input and will consider it in the large scope this project exists in. If we are unable to accommodate your request we will give you the
	reasons and are open to discuss them with you to a sensible degree.
* We are not always right and encourage a public discourse to smooth these edges we humans have when we think we're right.
* Please remember that we are doing the best we can and sometimes that means we are stuck in meetings and can't reply right away. We promiss we probably
	already saw your issue by glancing at our phones in the meeting and are thinking about what you said while unable to reply because our boss is
	talking in front and and we have to hide our phone under the table. Now we have to also remember what our boss just said. Darn!
