> This library of icons is intended for use across all of our brands and user interfaces. They are designed to aid navigation and legibility. The use of
> icons purely as page embellishment is not recommended and in some cases will be off brand. These icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVGs)
> with PNG fallbacks for older browsers. Using SVGs ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the icons using code and also
> complies with AA accessibility requirements.
