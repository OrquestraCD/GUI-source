> This library of icons is intended for use across all of our brands and user interfaces. They are designed to aid navigation and legibility. The use of icons
> purely as page embellishment is not recommended and in some cases will be off brand. These icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVGs) with
> PNG fallbacks for older browsers. Using SVGs ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the icons using code and also
> complies with AA accessibility requirements.

### Release History

* v2.0.2 - `SVG` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Remove secondary `.symbol-*` prefix from all Icons. Icons use the `.icon-*` prefix and Symbols use the `.symbol-*` prefix exclusively.
* v2.0.1 - `SVG` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* It’s with great regret that we announce the removal of the sad face icon and it’s good friends happy and indifferent.
		Due to circumstances beyond our control we’ve been asked to delete our emoji friends from the GUI.
		Please spare a thought for these brave little characters. They brought sentiment, humanity and honesty to our interfaces and customers.

* v2.0.0 - `SVG` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~

* v1.0.2 - `SVG` ~~`LESS/CSS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
