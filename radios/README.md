		[#151](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/151)
	* Printing the radios although not very functional, will now at least look good and make clear what selection was selected.
	* Some love was given to IE8 though we can’t say the browser seems to return our affection.
* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `SVG` `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
	* All SVGs now come with a unique title ID. That may not sound like much but SVGs are very particular about their individualism.
		[#204](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/204)
* v1.0.4 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* The radios didn't flip anymore. Rather than flipping them off we taught them. Flipping awesome!
		[#197](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/197)
* v1.0.3 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Tune in to our radio buttons. We've added a no-image fallback to the them so when you're tired of seeing our beautiful designed artwork, you now have a
		fallback to the old boring native radios, boooooo.
		[#173](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/173)
* v1.0.2 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* BIG BOM brand change. All new colours, all new look, all new GUI. Brace yourselfs.
		[#157](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/157)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`JS`~~ ~~`HTML`~~
	* In some browsers the radios appeared cut-off. That seemed a bit shy and insecure so we sent them to counselling. Now radios
		proudly present their bottoms as well. [#128](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/128)
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
