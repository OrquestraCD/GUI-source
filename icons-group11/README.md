GUI Icon-group11
================

> This library of icons is intended for use across all of our brands and user interfaces. They are designed to aid navigation and legibility. The use of icons
> purely as page embellishment is not recommended and in some cases will be off brand. These icons are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVG’s) with
> png fallback’s for older browsers. Using SVG’s ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the icons using code and also
> complies with AA accessibility requirements.
