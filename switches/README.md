### Release History

* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` `HTML` ~~`JS`~~
	* Being the new kid on the block, the switches needed a good talking to about the rules of the GUI street. All GUI kids need to be printable, have disabled
		states and behave while playing with the others(speak: no shadows that make them look fuzzy). The switches promised to better and from now on hang
		around in the forms category where other like-minded GUI modules hang around. Proud parents here.
