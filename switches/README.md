> These are very simple toggle switches ideal for use in settings or preference screens. The switch can be blank or contain a simple string for example;
> yes/no, on/off etc. Please note: These switches are a fixed width. They are not for use with longs text strings.

### Release History

* v2.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* Fanfare, Drum roll … We’ve added another brand. Yay! :clap:
* v2.0.0 - `LESS/CSS` ~~`HTML`~~ ~~`JS`~~
	* To make it easier to switch brands with Less we’ve added a brand variable. Building multibrand sites has never been this easy!
		[#203](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/203)
* v1.0.1 - `LESS/CSS` `HTML` ~~`JS`~~
	* Being the new kid on the block, the switches needed a good talking to about the rules of the GUI street. All GUI kids need to be printable, have disabled
		states and behave while playing with the others. The switches promised to better and from now on hang
		around in the forms category where other like-minded GUI modules hang around. Proud parents here.
		[#155](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/155), [#156](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/156),
		[#153](https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-source/issues/153)
	* We removed the buff flavour of the switches. The class sounded cool but making it look different caused more confusion than coolness.
* v1.0.0 - Initial port
